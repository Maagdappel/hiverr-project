# hiverr-project
This project is about collecting data for beekeepers on a self hosted application.

This application is supposed to track information about hives. More specifically, the queens within your hives, brood boxes or honey supers used in your hives. There might be more features added later on, these are the main ones I will focus on for now. 

HIVES:

Hives in the application should be something you can interact with and edit. You should be able to edit the amount of brood boxes and honey supers on the specified hive. Of course, there will also be an option to add more than one hive. I'd also like to add a function where you can see the estimated amount of bees in the hive, I haven't decided yet if I will make it so the application tracks the bees gender as well. I'd like to make this based upon manual entries and calculations based on the queen's laying speed.

An option to track the estimated amount of honey currently in the hive and the amount when it's harvest time. This will then also have a function in which you can enter the amount of honey harvested. Along with this function, i'd like the option to see the honey harvest of the current year of all hives you have, but also the option for the amount of all time.

QUEENS:

Information about the queen in a hive is made up of: DOB (Date of Birth), color on her back, based upon her DOB and amount of bees born under her "rule".
